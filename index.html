      <p>If futurism is a term that describes our anticipation of what is to come, then retrofuturism describes how we
        remember these visions. The term itself is laden with ambiguity, however. Where futurism is sometimes called a
        ‚Äúscience‚Äù bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation.

      <h2>üöÄ Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        Retrofuturism has two overlapping trends: the future as seen from the past and the past as seen from the future.
      </p>

      <p>The first one is inspired by the imagined future in the 1960s. The visions of future were in the projections of
        existing technology, or science fiction novels. These visions are updated for the present, and offer a nostalgic
        image of what the future might have been.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second one is the futuristic retro. One great example of this is steampunk, which is the application of
        neo-Victorian styles to modern technology. It starts with the retro content, and then mix it with futuristic
        technology. </p>

      <h2>üèô Background</h2>

      <p>
        The artworks of retro-futurism also explore the tension between past and future, and between the alienating and
        empowering effects of technology.</p>
      <p>
        Retrofuturism was shaped in the 1970s when there were rapid and intense changes in technology. The computers
        were invented, and the future looked promising. The futurists of that time period had some visions like the
        space colonies, robotic servants, and interstellar travel. However, retrofuturism sees these visions from a
        skeptical perspective. These visions may never come true, and at the same time, with the Vietnam war and the
        energy crisis, people started to question the benefits of technology. The anticipated future will not be
        realized, and technology may not improve our civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this circumstance, retrofuturism becomes an ideology, which is the future does not exist
        except as an act of belief or imagination.

      <h2>‚úàÔ∏è The slow cancellation of the future. (Franco ‚ÄòBifo‚Äô Berardi)
      </h2>

      <p>Another way to perceive retrofuturism is through the idea, the slow cancellation of the future. We
        paradoxically try to relive our anticipations of a future by going back to the past.</p>


      <p>Cultural time has folded back on itself. --Mark Fisher</p>
      <p>
        Mark Fisher has applied the idea of the cancellation of future to the development of cultural movements. ‚ÄúWe are
        trapped in a condition where there is no longer real and significant cultural movement or development,
        there is no longer a future. The whole subjective dimension of the future has gradually disappeared, been
        cancelled, so we find ourselves repeating the past. The innovation, sense of possibility, and continuous
        production of newness seen in the 20th-century culture of popular modernism no longer exists. Culture today
        largely remains in the past.‚Äù</p>
      <p>
        According to Mark Fisher, the dominance of neoliberalism has led us to a cultural impasse. Neoliberalism
        demands short term solutions, quick results, and the repetition of old already established cultural forms.
        People are no longer trying to anticipate the future to conceive of new worlds. Although the technological
        progress hasn‚Äôt stopped, in the past, the emergence of new technologies enables new cultural forms, but today,
        new technologies are subordinated to the repetition and refurbishment of old already established cultural forms.
